## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. **Immediate Action**: Focus medical resources on 17 high-risk players
2. **Monitoring**: Implement monthly risk reassessment 
3. **Integration**: Combine model predictions with medical staff judgment
4. **Data Updates**: Retrain model every 6 months with new performance data

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Model learns from playing patterns, workload, and physical demands
- No dependency on injury history (eliminates bias)
- Suitable for integration with existing medical protocols
- Designed for early intervention and resource allocation
